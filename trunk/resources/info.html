CacheWolf was created sometime 2003 to enable paperless caching with a Sharp Zaurus.
As it was written in Java it was natural that after a while requests originated
asking if it was possible to run the Wolf on Pocket PCs. But the existing Java
Virtual Machines just did not deliver the required performance.<br>
CacheWolf was then reprogrammed using EWE, a Java like virtual machine.<BR><BR>

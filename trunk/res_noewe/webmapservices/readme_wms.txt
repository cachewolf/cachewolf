# copy and rename this file to the extension .wms
# You can add your own .wms file to this directory 
# and the new service will be available in the download maps dialog
# name the file this way: <internet domain of the covered region, replace "." by "-" and inverse the order>_<type of map>_<original scale>.wms
# e.g. "de-ni_topo_50", meaning germany (de), Niedersachen (ni), topographical map, original scale 1:50000.
# Please don't use capital letter or special characters (only "a-z0-9" and "-_" are allowed) 
# in the filename in order to avoid problems on different platforms
# Please include in every .wms you create a reference to this explanation file

# The EPSG-Code, supported by cachewolf: German Gauß-Krüger (31466, 31467, 31468, 
# 31469), Italian Gauß-Boaga (3003 and 3004), Austrian Lambert old (31287) and
# new (31287) and WGS84 (4326)
# You get a list of supported coordinate systems from the WMS in the getCapabilieties 
# answer under <Layer><SRS> or <CRS>
# Please feel free to ask for another coordinate system to be supported by cachewolf 
# if you need it
# Many servers say they support several EPSG codes. My experience is
# that usually the projection which was used for the scanned analog material
# offer the best calibration and image quality. That's why you should test 
# the calibration especially when using epsg:4326 (WGS84) [there is no printed
# map in that format].
# In countries which cover a big area of the world (like Germany, unlike Austria)
# we have zones (or stripes) which each has its own epsg code. But they all
# belong to the same local system. In this case
# put all the EPSG codes which (a) belong to the same local system and 
# which (b) are supported by the server here, separated by a space. 
# CacheWolf will automatically make use of the correct zone and according epsg code. 
# The sequence of strings in the UrlPart must match sequence of the corresponding numbers here.
# Sometimes the wms-Server provides only one stripe, in spite of the fact, that
# the map it provides is not completely within this stripe. In this case
# just list only this epsg code. CacheWolf will automatically calculate the
# local system for that zone (e.g. Gauß-Krüger coordinates for that stripe).
# remark: some WMS offer WGS84 (EPSG 4326), but they are sometimes working not
# correctly (for example the WMS of the Landesvermessungsamt NRW as of nov. 2007)
# In this case don't list it.
# don't mix different local systems.

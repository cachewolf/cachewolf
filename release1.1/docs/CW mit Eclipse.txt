How to build your own development environment for CacheWolf
===========================================================

It is quite easy. All you need is 
1. a java compiler (javac from sun or gcj)
2. a svn client
3. if you want comfortable programming: an integrated development environment (IDE). We recommend to use Eclipse.

For most easy installing, you can use the package "EasyEclipse Desktop" as it contains all 3 items in one installation package and is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS. (In eclipse the plugin "subclipse" is the svn client)

Steps:

1. goto http://www.easyeclipse.org/site/distributions/index.html and download the newest "EasyEclipse for java" (any version should work, I used "EasyEclipse Desktop v1.3.1.1").

2. install it.

3. start eclipse, you will be asked for an directory name where to store eclipse projects. Select / create an directory in your home dir. 

4. In eclipse create a new projet from svn: 
a) click: File -> new -> Projet, 
b) select SVN, and "Check out projects from SVN" -> next
c) select "Create a new repositoy location" -> next
d) enter: http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/cachewolf -> next
e) wait until the directories appear, select the first item, ending with "trunk" -> next
f) select "Check out as project using new project wizard" 
g) new project wizard appears. Select Java Project and enter a project name, e.g. "cachewolf" -> finish, wait until all the source code and supplemental programs from the svn is downloaded
h) if you still see the "welcome screen" click on "workbench"

5. Now we need to configure the project. Therefore:
a) Click in the menu: project -> properties -> Run/Debug Settings, Click "New..." and choose "Java Application"
b) In the "Name" field enter "CacheWolf" (or any other name that is convenient)
c) in field "Main Class" enter "Ewe"
d) click on the tab "Arguments" and enter as "Program arguments" "CacheWolf.CacheWolf", und "working directory" select "other", click on button "workspace" and select "work" -> ok.
e) click on the tab "classpath", select "user entries" and remove all entries below.
f) select "user entries", "Add projects", select "Cachewolf" -> ok
g) select "user entries" and click on button "add JARs", select cachewolf/lib/JavaEwe.zip -> ok.
h) select "user entries" and click on "Advanced", keep "Add Folder", click "Ok", select cachewolf/lib
i) Click ok till all windows are closed.

6. copy the needed ressources into the working directory by double clicking on getres.bat or getres.sh on the filemanager (windows exploprer)

7. to compile and run cachewolf click in the menu in eclipse the menu run -> run or click the "play" icon or press ctrl-f11.

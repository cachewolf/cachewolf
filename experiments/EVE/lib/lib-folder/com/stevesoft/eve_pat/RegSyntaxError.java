/** When enabled, this class is thrown instead of
    the normal RegSyntax.  Thus, enabling of this
    class will make your debugging easier -- but
    if you leave it on and forget to catch RegSyntaxError
    a user-supplied pattern could generate a
    RegSyntaxError that will kill your application.

    I strongly recommend turning this flag on, however,
    as I think it is more likely to help than to hurt
    your programming efforts.

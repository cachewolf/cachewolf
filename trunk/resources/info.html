<strong>A geocaching programm</strong><br>

from Bilbowolf, Kalli, Blackeye501<br>
for Windows, Linux and Pocket PC</em><br>
<br>
Cachewolf was created sometime 2003 to enable paperless caching with a Sharp Zaurus.
As it was written in Java it was natural that after a while requests originated 
asking if it was possible to run the Wolf on Pocket PCs. But the existing Java 
Virtual Machines just did not deliver the required performance.<br>
Cachewolf was then reprogrammed using EWE, a Java like virtual machine. The source code 
was released on www.aragorn.de and soon Kalli and Blackeye501 joined the team and 
contributed to various parts of the Wolf!<br><br>
